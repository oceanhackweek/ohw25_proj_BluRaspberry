Optimal AUV Path Planning Using Numerical Ocean Models

**Folder Structure**

* `contributor_folders` (optional) Each contributor can make a folder here and 
push their work here during the week. This will allow everyone to see each others work but prevent any merge conflicts. It is good if participants are new to collaborative coding.
* `final_notebooks` When the team develops shared final notebooks, they 
can be shared here. Make sure to communicate so that you limit merge conflicts.
* `scripts` Shared scripts or functions can be added here.
* `data` Shared dataset can be shared here. Note, do not put large datasets on GitHub. Speak to the organizers if you 
need to share large datasets. Each team member can have a version of the dataset locally in the same folder to 
preserve relative paths, but the dataset does not need to be added to git/GitHub (you can useÂ `.gitignore`).

You can start with a simple structure and as you progress you can refine it to contain more components. [Here](https://cookiecutter-data-science.drivendata.org/#directory-structure) is an example of a more elaborate structure for a data science project.

## One-line Description
Our goal is to develop a system that specifies an optimal path for an AUV using numerical circulation models.

## Background

## Goals
**Optimization Function for Path Planning**
- Develop an algorithm that dynamically adjusts AUV navigation points to maximize sampling efficiency of biological targets (e.g., algal blooms).
- Incorporate environmental variables such as currents, temperature, salinity, oxygen utilization, water age, and seafloor distribution.

**Integration with Robotic Control Systems**
- Build scripts to interface between Python-based optimization functions and ROS2, potential enabling direct deployment on AUV platforms.
- Ensure compatibility with Gazebo for simulation testing.

**Scalable Cloud Implementation**
- Run scripts on large oceanographic datasets in cloud environments .


## Datasets and Methodology
**AUV Control and Simulation**
- ROS2
- Gazebo

**Simulated Ocean field**
- OCIM (Ocean Circulation Inverse Model)
- ROMs
