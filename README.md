# BluRaspberry
Optimal unmanned underwater vehicle (UUV) Path Planning Using Numerical Ocean Models

**Folder Structure**
* `final_notebooks` Notebook that you can check out if you interested in the process or reproduce what we did.
* `data` Dataset can be shared here.

<!--More elaborate structure for a data science project: [Here](https://cookiecutter-data-science.drivendata.org/#directory-structure) is an example of a more elaborate structure for a data science project.-->

## One-line Description
We aim to develop a system that determine the optimal path for an AUV to explore biologically active regions (e.g., algal blooms).

## Planning

* Initial idea: use numerical model outputs to simulate potential scenarios for the UUV

## Background

## Goals
**Optimization Function for Path Planning**
- Develop an algorithm that dynamically adjusts AUV navigation points to maximize sampling efficiency of biological targets (e.g., algal blooms).
- Incorporate environmental variables such as currents, temperature, salinity, oxygen utilization, water age, and seafloor distribution.

**Integration with Robotic Control Systems**
- Build scripts to interface between Python-based optimization functions and ROS2, potential enabling direct deployment on AUV platforms.
- Ensure compatibility with Gazebo for simulation testing.

**Scalable Cloud Implementation**
- Run scripts on large oceanographic datasets in cloud environments .
